### How to use

#### Building GATE

##### Step 1. Build kNN Graph and Indexing NSG

Firstly, we need to prepare a kNN graph. You can use Faiss and other libs. 

Then run the script for indexing NSG:

```
./tests/test_nsg_index DATA_PATH KNNG_PATH L R C NSG_PATH
```

- `DATA_PATH` is the path of the base data in `fvecs` format.
- `KNNG_PATH` is the path of the pre-built kNN graph.
- `L` controls the quality of the NSG.
- `R` controls the index size of the graph.
- `C` controls the maximum candidate pool size during NSG contruction.
- `NSG_PATH` is the path of the generated NSG index.



##### Step 2. Hub Nodes Extraction and Topological Semantic Generation

```shell
python -m cluster.kmeans DATA_PATH HUB_PATH
python -m cluster.subgraph2json NSG_PATH DATA_PATH HUB_PATH SUBGRAPH_DIR
```

- `DATA_PATH` is the path of the base data in `fvecs` format.
- `NSG_PATH` is the path of the generated NSG index.
- `HUB_PATH` is the path of the hub nodes extraction.
- `SUBGRAPH_DIR` is the subgraph dir

Then, we run the graph embedding model, convert subgraph to embeddings. You can use [Graph2Vec](https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/graph2vec) and other model.



##### Step 3. Query-aware Sample Generation, Model Training and Inference

```
./test_nsg_search DATA_PATH QUERY_PATH NSG_PATH SEARCH_L SEARCH_K RESULT_PATH HUB_PATH HOP_PATH
python -m cluster.experiment.combine_ep_gt HOP_PATH SAMPLE_PATH
```

- `DATA_PATH` is the path of the base data in `fvecs` format.
- `QUERY_PATH` is the path of the query data in `fvecs` format.
- `NSG_PATH` is the path of the pre-built NSG index in previous section.
- `SEARCH_L` controls the quality of the search results.
- `SEARCH_K` controls the number of result neighbors we want to query.
- `RESULT_PATH` is the query results in `ivecs` format.
- `HUB_PATH` is the path of the hub nodes extraction.
- `HOP_PATH` is the path of the routing hop.
- `SAMPLE_PATH` is the path of the traning sample data.



Then configure the trainning parameters, run `cluster/model/__main__.py` to train the model and run `cluster/model/infer.py` to get hub nodes' embeddings when model trained.

```json
{
    "input_dim": 128,
    "hidden_dim": 2024,
    "output_dim": 512,
    "dropout": 0.05,

    "batch_size": 16384,
    "lr": 1e-5,
    "temperature": 0.07,
    "epochs": 200
}
```



#### Searching via GATE

```shell
./tests/test_gate_search DATA_PATH QUERY_PATH NSG_PATH SEARCH_L SEARCH_K EMB_PATH RESULT_PATH
```

- `DATA_PATH` is the path of the base data in `fvecs` format.
- `QUERY_PATH` is the path of the query data in `fvecs` format.
- `NSG_PATH` is the path of the pre-built NSG index in previous section.
- `SEARCH_L` controls the quality of the search results.
- `SEARCH_K` controls the number of result neighbors we want to query.
- `HUB_PATH` is the path of the hub nodes extraction.
- `EMB_PATH` is the path of the hub nodes' embeddings.
- `RESULT_PATH` is the query results in `ivecs` format.
